              <p> Somebody who finds refuge from the sheer mundanity of everyday life in the bosom of a particularly engrossing videogame. General stereotypes have already been mentioned, but in my experience with fellow gamers, they are largely misanthropic and just find most people uninteresting. This could perhaps explain why many are seen as socially inept and introverted, but then again, I doubt misanthropia is a popular mindset. The gamers I know are well-read and erudite (in contrast with the idea that games 'rot your brain' - ever noticed how people who make such claims are usually Big Brother watching idiots themselves?).
                  Video games - because real life is for poseurs. </p>
